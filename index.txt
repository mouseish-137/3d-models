Model scale identification for gcode files:
0xx = Models optimized for 50% scale use
1xx = Models optimized for 100% scale use
7xx = Models optimized for 70% scale use

Using this naming convention, others will easily be able to identify a model using its 2 (*.stl) or 3 (*.gcode) digit numerical ID.
For example, any asset with the identification number of 704 would be undderstood to be a Volcano model sliced at 70% scale.
