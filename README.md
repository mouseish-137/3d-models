# 3d-models
Here's some various stuff I shove down my 3D printer's nozzle when I'm bored.

**index.txt** contains a list of models and a brief explanation of my model numbering scheme.

Each category contains a stl directory as well as a gcode directory for my preferred slice of the corresponding stl.
The gcode is sliced for a stock Ender 3 printer with a 0.2mm nozzle, 235C nozzle temp and 74C bed temp.
Because of the differneces in each users printer and filament, I suggest using the stl files and slicing to best fit your needs.

Feel free to use this stuff for personal projects but try not to sell anything if you didn't make it or fix it first  <3
