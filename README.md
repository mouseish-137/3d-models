# 3d-models
Stuff I shove down the 3D printer when I'm bored.

index.txt contains a list of models and a brief expla nation of my model numbering scheme.

Each category contains a stl directory as well as a gcode directory for my preferred slice of the corresponding stl.
The gcode is sliced for a stock Ender 3 printer with a 0.2mm nozzle, so I suggest using the stl files and slicing to fit your print needs.
