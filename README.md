# 3d-models
Stuff I shove down the 3D printer when I'm bored.

index.txt contains a list of models and a brief expla nation of my model numbering scheme.

Each category contains a stl directory as well as a gcode directory for my preferred slice of the corresponding stl.
The gcode is sliced for a stock Ender 3 printer with a 0.2mm nozzle, so I suggest using the stl files and slicing to fit your print needs.

Feel free to use this stuff for personal projects but try not to sell anything if you didn't make it  <3
